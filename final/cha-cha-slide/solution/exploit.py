#to get this shellcode value, i went into GDB and did:
#   (address of shellcode - address of input)
#it seemed like i was overflowing the shellcode a bit,
#and observing the stack i could tell i was ~3 bytes over
#so i took 3 away and got a shell!
#
#we can leave our payload as just random cyclic characters
#because the program replaces them with nops for us
#
#useful command for observing the stack to get all this info:
#   "tele $rsp 100"
