### Intuition Behind Exploitation 
[This is a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akCce7vSSfw) that sums up everything that we've learned so far, and it also helps give you an intuition for binary exploitation.

### From Zero to Zero Day
If you're interested in doing research in the field of security, then [this video is for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp1YDOtWohw&t=1632s). This is a talk about how an eighteen-year-old went from doing basic stack overflows to finding zero days. He even provides a working demo of the exploit he created and how he went about finding the vulnerability.
